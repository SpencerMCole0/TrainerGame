# TrainerGame 💪

TrainerGame is an endless career-based clicker game where players choose between two fitness career paths—**Weightlifting** or **Powerlifting**. Players train by clicking to complete reps, earning "Strength Bucks" with each rep, and use those to buy upgrades and progress deeper into their training journey.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this game is to simulate a stylized, addicting fitness progression loop, where players continuously improve one stat (either **reps** or **weight**) per session. The game emphasizes progression strategy, upgrade timing, and career-specific builds.

Eventually, I want to evolve this into a polished desktop or web game, with unique paths, risk/reward upgrades (like steroids), competitions, and visual upgrades.

## 🧠 How I Use ChatGPT (My Assistant)

ChatGPT is my main collaborator on this project. Here's how I plan to use it:

- **Design Systems**: Help brainstorm and refine game mechanics, upgrade trees, and progression balance.
- **Write Code**: Assist in creating and optimizing code for logic, UI, upgrades, save systems, etc.
- **Debug**: Review code and help resolve bugs or performance issues.
- **Plan Features**: Organize feature milestones and suggest technical architecture.
- **Document**: Help write clear code comments, guides, and update logs.

I'll provide ChatGPT with project updates and goals, and it will respond with written code, gameplay improvements, or implementation steps.

## 🚀 Game Core Loop

1. **Pick Career Path**: Weightlifter or Powerlifter.
2. **Do Reps**: Click to perform reps, which earns Strength Bucks.
3. **Increase ONE Stat**: After each set, you may choose to increase either max weight or max reps—but not both.
4. **Rest**: Reset fatigue and prep for a new session.
5. **Buy Upgrades**: Spend Strength Bucks to improve your gains, rest time, or abilities.

## 💬 ChatGPT Notes

If you're ChatGPT:
- You can read this file to understand my vision.
- Always ask for clarification if a feature is ambiguous.
- Feel free to suggest improvements, but keep the core loop intact.
